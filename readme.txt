== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know the form is connecting? =

After you connect the form and get your API key, test the form is sending data by sending a test message. Send the message then login to your Contact Plus account. You should see an open inquiry in Contact Form Summary widget and a notification for a new Contact Form under Main Menu.

= How does an open inquiry become closed? =

Go to the Contact Form page. Go to Workflow button and select Close. Other options include sub route, which lets you select a person to notify that they are now assigned to the task.

= Can I delete spam inquiries? =

There is no delete at this time. The best option is to add a Status field that lets you identify spam. Then close the workflow to get it off your plate.

= Can I create a task for someone from the page? =

You can take a page and assign someone else a task directly from the page without losing what you are doing. Go to Workflow menu and select subroute to create a task for them to do. They will assign it back to you when they route it from the workflow menu.

= Can we send someone a direct message in your system? =

Yes, you can send a direct message when you are in the workspace page. Go to Take a Look in the menu. Messages will only be visible to people you add.

= How do I add a new department? =

From the home page to go Add Page. Select Department from the dropdown, then add your department name and click save. Click Publish when you complete your edits and are ready to add it to your account. Then your forms are ready to be configured to connect to that page.
